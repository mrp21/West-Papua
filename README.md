# West-Papua
Code for analysis of acoustic indices

Repository for R code used in analysing acoustic data collected from West Papua 

Includes the following code;

1) Acoustic Indices Extraction
2) Acoustic Index Temporal correlation analysis
3) IDCF_AI_GLM_4_nomotor
4) Mean Spectrum distance based redundancy analysis
5) Model_deviance_correlation_analysis

Please note this code is not 'elegant' and based on references in the annotation, but it does the job!

Also note that to apply it you will have to make some manual adaptations to choose parameters within the code itself.
